// in JS, there are actually two ways to declare a variable. First one is with const and the next one is with let 

const PI = 3.1416;
let num = 1;
let num2 = 2.5;
let flag = false;

// naming convention

const NAME = 'Fatima'
let firstNumber = 2;   // camel case
let second_number = 32;  // pascal case

// output
console.log("hello world!");

// operators *, -, +, / ===, **

let thirdnumber = firstNumber + second_number;
console.log(thirdnumber);

// conditional statements

if (firstNumber === second_number) {
    console.log("Numbers are equal")
} else {
    console.log("Numbers are not equal")
}
